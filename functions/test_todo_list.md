## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue causing test failures is **Firebase initialization conflict**. The source code contains top-level Firebase initialization:

```typescript
// Initialize Firebase
if (!admin.apps.length) {
  admin.initializeApp();
}
```

However, the test environment stubs `admin.initializeApp` to prevent actual initialization, leading to services like Firestore and Storage failing with "app/no-app" errors.

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Refactor Source Code**: Modify Firebase service usage to use lazy initialization patterns instead of top-level initialization
2. **Improve Test Stubs**: Enhance test setup to properly mock all Firebase services before source code imports
3. **Use Dependency Injection**: Consider refactoring to inject Firebase services for better testability
4. **Module Mocking**: Use tools like `proxyquire` to mock dependencies during import

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Focus on fixing Firebase initialization in test environment
2. Address assertion errors in failing tests
3. Run tests after each fix to verify improvements
4. Update this todo list as tests are fixed

## Current Test Statistics
- **Total Tests:** 48
- **Passing:** 23 (47.9%)
- **Failing:** 25 (52.1%)
- **Primary Issue:** Firebase initialization conflicts in test environment
